After worked in multinationals for decades, I was so sick and tired of office politics. Then I drowned myself in startups for several years. I am sort of free to choose whatever I want for our working setup.

Well, with good comes the bad. We have very limited budget for tools/apps. Basically, there are lots of alternatives for project management. For example, Asana and Trello are good choices for task management, while Linear for issue tracker(Jira is too clumsy). Yes indeed, there are free tier or free plans for trial.

The thing is:

* Free tier/plan usually means limitation of usage. Take Linear for instance, 250 issues could be raised with free plan, which is way too limited especially during new product launching phase for startups.
* The pricing is always charged per user, like Asana, Notion, Linear, etc. Not that high respectively. But the total amount is really a thing for the startup if subscribing numbers of services.
* Itâ€™s really distracting for team members to switch context frequently among different apps to check TODOs or tasks.

Finally I found a way to use Notion as an affordable all-in-one collaboration tool in our team. And we have used this system for couple of months. So far so good.

The funny thing is, after building and fine-tuning this system for a few weeks, I showed it to my wife proudly and waited for her encouragement. She joked,

> Uh, can you make money on it?

Why not? I thought. So I launched Teamwork.
